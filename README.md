### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Python 3.x (for local development server)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lazycal.git
   cd lazycal
   ```

2. **Start the local server**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Alternative Setup

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Creating Your First Task

1. Click the **"Add Task"** button in the Task List view
2. Fill in the task details:
   - **Name**: What you need to accomplish
   - **Total Workload**: How much work in total (e.g., 20 pages)
   - **Unit**: Choose from presets or create custom units
   - **Start/Due Dates**: When to begin and finish
   - **Priority**: 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)
   - **Procrastination Coefficient**: 0 (no procrastination) to 1 (maximum)

### 2. Understanding the Procrastination Algorithm

LazyCal uses a smart algorithm to adjust your daily workload:

```
Daily Workload = Total Workload ÷ Available Days (rounded up)
Adjusted Daily Workload = Daily Workload × (1 + Procrastination Coefficient) (rounded down)
```

**Example**: 
- Task: Write 10 pages over 2 days
- Procrastination Coefficient: 0.5
- Calculation: 5 pages/day × 1.5 = 7.5 → 7 pages/day (adjusted)

### 3. Daily Progress Tracking

- Set your preferred reminder time (default: 5:00 PM)
- Receive daily notifications to update progress
- Enter completed workload for each task
- Watch tasks automatically complete or become overdue

### 4. Using Different Views

- **Task List**: Manage all active tasks, sorted by priority and due date
- **Calendar**: See tasks distributed across time with color-coded priorities
- **Daily Panel**: Focus on today's workload and targets
- **Archive**: Review your productivity history and manage completed tasks

## 🎨 Priority Color System

- **Priority 5 (Highest)**: Red - Urgent tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Priority 4 (High)**: Orange - Important tasks with near deadlines
- **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Blue - Standard tasks with moderate importance
- **Priority 2 (Low)**: Yellow - Tasks that can be delayed if necessary
- **Priority 1 (Lowest)**: Gray - Optional or low-impact tasks

## 💾 Data Storage

LazyCal stores all your data locally in your browser using localStorage. This means:
- ✅ Your data stays private and secure
- ✅ No internet connection required after initial load
- ✅ Fast performance with instant updates
- ⚠️ Data is tied to your specific browser and device

### 🔄 Git Synchronization

**NEW**: You can now sync your tasks across multiple computers using Git! LazyCal includes export/import functionality that works perfectly with version control.

#### How to Set Up Git Sync:

1. **Initial Setup** (on your main computer):
   ```bash
   # In your LazyCal directory
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial LazyCal setup"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-lazycal-repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Export Your Tasks**:
   - Open LazyCal → Settings → Data Synchronization
   - Click "Export Tasks" to download `lazycal-data-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
   - Move this file to your LazyCal directory
   - Rename it to `lazycal-data.json` for consistency

3. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add lazycal-data.json
   git commit -m "Update tasks - $(date)"
   git push
   ```

4. **Sync on Other Computers**:
   ```bash
   # Clone or pull the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-lazycal-repo.git
   # or
   git pull

   # Open LazyCal in browser
   # Go to Settings → Data Synchronization
   # Click "Import Tasks" and select lazycal-data.json
   ```

#### Git Workflow Tips:

- **Daily Sync**: Export and commit your tasks at the end of each day
- **Branch Strategy**: Use branches for different contexts (work/personal)
- **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts occur, the most recent export usually contains the latest data
- **Backup Safety**: LazyCal automatically creates backups before importing

#### Example Git Workflow:
```bash
# Morning routine (pull latest tasks)
git pull
# Import the latest lazycal-data.json in the app

# Evening routine (save your progress)
# Export tasks from the app to lazycal-data.json
git add lazycal-data.json
git commit -m "Tasks update: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push
```
